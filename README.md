# AnimalGame
Game for programming

## Game Design Document

### Baby Dungeon Boss
_Summary of game’s story, focusing on gameplay_
The player is in control of a baby boss monster in a RPG world which has to fight to survive, collect treasure, recruit some friends-I mean minions to help it, and try to find a place that could become its dungeoun.

### Intended systems
_What can you do in the game?  How do enemies function?  What are the goals?  What are the mechanics?  What features do you need to implement?_
Collect treasure of varying value
Fight enemies
Recruit/Befriend some monster allies
Interact with some neutral monster/animal NPCs
Return and secure tresure and allies in your temporay lair (a glorified nest/lean-to)

### Intended audience
This game is for Casual gamers who like creatures and fans of rpgs. It would be for both men and women but would probably apeal a bit more to women. Seeing as I'm not a AAA developer and the game is fairly unique it would be for Indie gamers.

### 2-3 similar games
_Even the most unique and unusual games have similarities with existing games, even if the similarity is only how unusual the game is!  What games are most similar to this game.  Listing the specific features where appropriate_
* Dungeons 2 & 3 - playing as an evil protagonist in charge of other evil creatures
* Probably a few RPGs

### Unique selling points
_Is this game doing something that no other game has done before?  Is this game combining known features in a unique way?_
This game will sort of be a role-reversal of typical rpgs.

### What’s enjoyable/positive about this game?
_Why should I play this game?_
Because you play an 'evil' character, that's trying _very_ hard to be evil in a nice interesting world with some fun characters and things happening.
